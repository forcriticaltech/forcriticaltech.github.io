## Who We Are
The [open letter to
Springer](https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16)
is the result of a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort; more than twenty
scholars made significant contributions to early drafts. These contributions
were facilitated and synthesized by a core editorial team that includes:
[Chelsea Barabas](https://twitter.com/chels_bar) (MIT), [Audrey Beard](https://ethicsof.tech) (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), [Dr.
Theodora Dryer](https://twitter.com/theodorajewell) (NYU), [Dr. Beth Semel](https://twitter.com/bethmsemel) (MIT), and [Sonja Solomun](https://twitter.com/SonjaSolomun) (McGill).

The academic collective that has emerged from this process will engage in
future conversations as the [Coalition For Critical
Technology](twitter.com/forcriticaltech). We are part of a growing community of
scholars who are challenging academiaâ€™s key role in the creation and
maintenance of carceral technology. The Coalition aims to support larger
movements of scholars, technologists, and organizers who are working for
justice by resisting technologies that exacerbate inequality, reinforce racism,
and support the carceral state.

Our approach involves continuous reevaluation of epistemic norms and
interrogation of how knowledge is valued, created, and employed through
academic power structures.
